        Buyers are the heart of the BookMart community. Whether you're a casual reader or an avid collector, these terms explain your rights, responsibilities, and the purchasing process on our platform.
      </p>
      
      <div class="term-point">
        <i class="fa-solid fa-shop fa-icon"></i>
        <p>Buyers can purchase books from both bookstores and individual booksellers through the platform. This provides access to a diverse catalog ranging from the newest releases offered by established bookstores to rare and pre-loved titles from individual booksellers. Our integrated search and filtering system allows buyers to quickly find specific titles, authors, genres, or editions across all seller types. Personal recommendations based on purchase history and preferences are also provided to enhance the discovery experience.</p>

      <div class="term-point">
        <i class="fa-solid fa-gavel fa-icon"></i>
        <p>Buyers may participate in auctions for books listed by booksellers and place bids according to the auction rules. When placing a bid, buyers enter into a commitment to purchase the item if they are the highest bidder when the auction closes. Automatic bidding is available, allowing buyers to set a maximum amount they're willing to pay, with the system incrementally increasing their bid as needed to maintain the leading position. Buyers will receive notifications when they are outbid or when auctions they're participating in are nearing completion.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="term-point">
        <i class="fa-solid fa-map-location-dot fa-icon"></i>
        <p>It is the buyer's responsibility to ensure the accuracy of delivery information to avoid delays or failed deliveries. This includes providing a complete address with all necessary details such as building numbers, apartment numbers, landmarks, and accurate postal codes. Buyers should also include contact information that can be accessed during delivery hours. If a delivery fails due to incorrect address information, additional delivery fees may apply for reattempts. BookMart maintains a saved addresses feature to reduce errors in frequently used delivery locations.</p>

      <div class="term-point">
        <i class="fa-solid fa-credit-card fa-icon"></i>
        <p>Payment methods accepted include credit/debit cards, online banking, and approved digital wallets. All transactions are processed through secure payment gateways that meet international security standards. Buyers can save payment methods securely for future purchases, making checkout faster and more convenient. BookMart does not store complete card details on our servers. For security reasons, certain high-value purchases may require additional verification steps before processing.</p>

      <div class="term-point">
        <i class="fa-solid fa-rotate-left fa-icon"></i>
        <p>Buyers are entitled to return policies as specified by individual sellers, which must be clearly stated on product listings. These policies vary between sellers but must comply with BookMart's minimum standards for consumer protection. Generally, new books purchased from bookstores can be returned within 7 days if they arrive damaged or do not match the description. For second-hand books from individual booksellers, return policies may be more restricted, particularly for auction purchases. BookMart provides a messaging system for buyers to discuss potential returns directly with sellers.</p>

        <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info fa-icon"></i>
        <strong>Note:</strong>
        <p>BookMart serves as a platform facilitating transactions between buyers and sellers. For any product-specific issues, buyers should first contact the seller directly through our messaging system. If a resolution cannot be reached, BookMart's customer support team can intervene to mediate the dispute according to our fair resolution policy. We maintain a buyer protection program for eligible purchases to ensure satisfaction with every transaction.</p>

        BookMart empowers registered bookstores to reach customers online through our comprehensive platform. The following terms govern the relationship between BookMart and participating bookstores.

      <div class="term-point">
        <i class="fa-solid fa-tag fa-icon"></i>
        <p>Bookstores registered with BookMart are granted the authority to list and sell new books through our platform. This includes the ability to manage inventory, set pricing, and process customer orders. All listings must accurately represent the books being sold, including edition, condition, and availability. BookMart reserves the right to remove listings that do not comply with our content guidelines or that misrepresent products.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="term-point">
        <i class="fa-solid fa-percentage fa-icon"></i>
        <p>A <span class="highlight-privacy">10% commission</span> is charged on each successful order processed through BookMart. This commission is automatically calculated and deducted from the total order value before settlement. The commission helps support platform maintenance, marketing efforts, and continuous improvement of services provided to all BookMart users. The commission structure may be periodically reviewed, with any changes communicated to bookstores with appropriate notice.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="term-point">
        <i class="fa-solid fa-money-bill-transfer fa-icon"></i>
        <p>All payments are settled within <span class="highlight-privacy">7 business days</span> following order confirmation. This settlement period begins once the customer has confirmed receipt of their order or after the delivery confirmation has been provided by the courier. Payment transfers are made directly to the bank account registered by the bookstore during onboarding. BookMart is not responsible for delays caused by banking systems or incorrect bank details provided by the bookstore.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="term-point">
        <i class="fa-solid fa-file-invoice-dollar fa-icon"></i>
        <p>Complete payment details are accessible in the <span class="highlight-privacy">Payrolls</span> tab of your dashboard, and notifications will be sent upon settlement. This section provides a comprehensive record of all transactions, commissions, and payments. Bookstores can generate reports for specific date ranges, download invoices for accounting purposes, and track pending payments. Any discrepancies in payment records should be reported to BookMart support within 30 days of the settlement date.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="term-point">
        <i class="fa-solid fa-check-circle fa-icon"></i>
        <p>Bookstore advertisements must receive admin approval before they can be published on the platform. This review process ensures all promotional content meets BookMart's quality standards and accurately represents the products being sold. Approval typically takes 24-48 hours, and bookstores will be notified once their advertisements are approved or if any changes are required. BookMart reserves the right to reject advertisements that violate our content policies or contain misleading information.</p>

      <div class="note">
        <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info fa-icon"></i>
        <strong>Note:</strong>
        <p>Bookstores are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of their inventory listings and the timely preparation of orders for courier pickup. Failed deliveries due to inventory discrepancies or delays in order preparation may result in penalties or account restrictions. We recommend maintaining a buffer stock for popular items and promptly updating inventory counts to avoid customer disappointment.</p>

    <section id="booksellers">
      <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-user fa-icon"></i>Booksellers</h2>
      <p class="section-intro">
        Individual booksellers form an essential part of the BookMart community, bringing unique and pre-loved books to our marketplace. The following terms outline the rights and responsibilities of booksellers using our platform.
      </p>
      
      <div class="term-point">
        <i class="fa-solid fa-book-open fa-icon"></i>
        <p>Booksellers have the exclusive right to list second-hand books and participate in the <span class="highlight-privacy">auction system</span>. This unique privilege allows individual sellers to reach a wider audience of book enthusiasts interested in rare, out-of-print, or gently used titles. When listing second-hand books, booksellers must include clear photographs and detailed descriptions of any wear, markings, or imperfections to ensure buyer satisfaction. The auction system provides a fair marketplace where collectors and readers can compete for desired titles.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="term-point">
        <i class="fa-solid fa-gavel fa-icon"></i>
        <p>The auction feature is available only to booksellers and not to bookstores. This distinction helps maintain the unique character of the BookMart platform, where commercial entities and individual enthusiasts can coexist with clearly defined roles. Auctions run for a predetermined period set by the bookseller (3, 5, or 7 days), and the highest bidder at the close of the auction wins the right to purchase the item. Reserve prices may be set to protect sellers from unreasonably low bids.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="term-point">
        <i class="fa-solid fa-percentage fa-icon"></i>
        <p>A <span class="highlight-privacy">10% commission</span> is applied to all successful sales, whether through auction or fixed-price listings. This commission structure ensures fair treatment across all selling methods and supports the continued operation and improvement of the BookMart platform. The commission is automatically calculated and deducted from the final sale price before payment is transferred to the bookseller's account. Detailed commission calculations are available in the transaction history.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="term-point">
        <i class="fa-solid fa-calendar-check fa-icon"></i>
        <p>All payments are settled within <span class="highlight-privacy">7 business days</span> and will be reflected in the Payrolls tab. This settlement timeline begins after the buyer has confirmed receipt of the book or after the delivery confirmation has been provided by the courier. Booksellers can track pending payments, completed transactions, and expected deposit dates through their account dashboard. Email notifications are sent when payments are initiated and completed.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="term-point">
        <i class="fa-solid fa-lock fa-icon"></i>
        <p>Bank details collected during registration are used exclusively for payment settlements and are stored securely. BookMart employs industry-standard encryption and security practices to protect your financial information. Booksellers can update their banking details through the secure account settings page, with changes taking effect after verification to prevent unauthorized modifications. For security reasons, bank detail changes may require additional identity verification.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="term-point">
        <i class="fa-solid fa-magnifying-glass fa-icon"></i>
        <p>Booksellers are responsible for accurately describing the condition of second-hand books. This includes noting any damage, markings, missing pages, or other imperfections that might affect a buyer's decision. Repeated failure to accurately describe book conditions may result in negative reviews, account restrictions, or removal from the platform. BookMart encourages the use of standardized condition categories (Like New, Very Good, Good, Fair, Poor) along with detailed descriptions to set appropriate buyer expectations.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="note">
        <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-exclamation fa-icon"></i>
        <strong>Important:</strong>
        <p>The auction system is designed to be fair to both sellers and bidders. Once a bid is placed, it represents a commitment to purchase at that price if the auction ends with that bid as the highest. Booksellers should not cancel auctions prematurely unless there is a significant issue with the item being sold, as this undermines trust in the platform and may result in account penalties.</p>
      </div>

    <section id="couriers">
      <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-truck-fast fa-icon"></i>Couriers</h2>
      <p class="section-intro">
        Our courier partners are essential to delivering the BookMart experience directly to our customers. The following terms outline the partnership between BookMart and our courier network.
      </p>
      
      <div class="term-point">
        <i class="fa-solid fa-box fa-icon"></i>
        <p>Couriers are responsible for the safe and timely delivery of orders from sellers to buyers. This includes collecting packages from bookstores or individual booksellers, handling them with appropriate care, and delivering them to the specified address within the promised timeframe. Couriers represent BookMart during the final customer touchpoint and should maintain a professional demeanor and appearance. Delivery progress should be updated in real-time through the courier mobile application to provide transparency to both sellers and buyers.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="term-point">
        <i class="fa-solid fa-hand-holding-dollar fa-icon"></i>
        <p>A fixed delivery fee of <span class="highlight-privacy">Rs. 250</span> is earned per successful delivery. This fee compensates couriers for their time, transportation costs, and service quality. Additional compensation may be provided for deliveries to remote locations or during adverse weather conditions, as determined by BookMart's dynamic delivery fee system. Special handling fees may apply for particularly large orders or collections requiring multiple trips.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="term-point">
        <i class="fa-solid fa-percentage fa-icon"></i>
        <p>A <span class="highlight-privacy">10% commission</span> is deducted from each delivery fee, resulting in a net payment of <span class="highlight-privacy">Rs. 225</span> per delivery. This commission supports the technology infrastructure, customer service, and administrative costs associated with managing the courier network. The commission structure is subject to periodic review, with any changes communicated to couriers with appropriate advance notice. Performance incentives may be offered to high-performing couriers, potentially offsetting a portion of this commission.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="term-point">
        <i class="fa-solid fa-calendar-check fa-icon"></i>
        <p>All payments are settled within <span class="highlight-privacy">7 business days</span> and can be viewed in the Payrolls tab. Payment cycles run weekly, with all deliveries completed during the previous week included in the current payment batch. Couriers can track their earnings, pending payments, and payment history through their account dashboard. Automatic notifications are sent when payments are initiated and completed. Any payment discrepancies should be reported within 30 days of the expected settlement date.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="term-point">
        <i class="fa-solid fa-vault fa-icon"></i>
        <p>Bank account details collected during registration are used exclusively for payment processing. This sensitive information is encrypted and stored according to industry-standard security practices. Couriers can update their banking information through the secure account settings page when necessary. To prevent unauthorized changes, updates to payment information may require additional identity verification steps. BookMart does not share couriers' banking details with sellers or buyers.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="term-point">
        <i class="fa-solid fa-camera fa-icon"></i>
        <p>Couriers are required to provide delivery confirmation through the app, including photographic evidence when applicable. This confirmation serves as proof of successful delivery and triggers the payment process. For contactless deliveries, couriers must photograph the package at the delivery location in a way that clearly identifies the address. For in-person deliveries, obtaining the recipient's signature through the app is required. Failure to provide proper delivery confirmation may delay payment processing or result in delivery disputes.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="note">
        <i class="fa-solid fa-shield-halved fa-icon"></i>
        <strong>Important:</strong>
        <p>Couriers are entrusted with valuable merchandise and must exercise appropriate care during transportation and delivery. Any damage occurring during transit is the responsibility of the courier. BookMart provides optional courier insurance coverage that can be activated for a small percentage of earnings to protect against accidental damage claims. We recommend all couriers consider this protection to ensure peace of mind during operations.</p>
      </div>
